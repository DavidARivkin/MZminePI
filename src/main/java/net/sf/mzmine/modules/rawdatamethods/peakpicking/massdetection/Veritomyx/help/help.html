<h1>Veritomyx PeakInvestigator™ Peak Detection Software for Metabolomics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<blockquote>
<table><tr><td valign=top>
  <p>Mass spectral raw and processed results often fail to deconvolve and  consider crucial data. This contributes to inaccurate, incomplete and  inefficient protein and metabolite identifications. Veritomyx, Inc. mass  spectral analysis software applies advanced signal processing and  identification algorithms to reveal hidden data and accelerate to  correct biomolecular identifications. This improves R&amp;D  effectiveness while saving time and money.</p>

    <p>Critical data remain hidden when
      overlapping peaks are unresolved. Unresolved peaks cause:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Inaccurate IDs</li>
      <li>Misdirected efforts</li>
      <li>Wasted time and resources</li>
      <li>Missed biomarkers</li>
    </ul>
 </td><td valign="top"><img src="whatMissing.jpg"></td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan="2"><p><a href="http://www.veritomyx.com/PeakInvestigator.php">PeakInvestigator™</a> mass spectral analysis software detects and precisely deconvolves  hidden overlapped peaks, accelerating you to confident molecular  identifications in your metabolomics workflow. PeakInvestigator doubles  the effective resolution of virtually any existing mass analyzer. Unleashing important discoveries that would have remained hidden in your data offers critical leverage for scientific and business success.</p>

<h2>Processing Sequencing</h2>
<p>This is the process for using the Veritomyx PeakInvestigator module.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load a raw data file. Once you select the file or a set of scans (as shown) you are prepared to execute the process either by right-clicking on the raw data file as in the first figure or by selecting the menu as shown in the second figure.<br><br><img src="step01_MenuSelection.jpg"><br><br><img src="step02_PopupMenu.jpg"><br><br></li>
  <li>Once you have executed the Peaks/mass detection module, the following dialog will appear.<br><br><img src="step03_MassDetectorDialog.jpg"><br><br></li>
  <li>Select PeakInvestigator in the pulldown box and give the mass list a name. The selection of MS level is only applicable when you have selected the whole file for processing. In this case we provided a set of scans to process. While the job is being prepared to launch, the following task window will appear.<br><br><img src="step04_LaunchTaskask.jpg"><br><br></li>
  <li>Once the job is launched, you will see the job appear under the raw data file. At this point, the job has been sent to the Veritomyx servers for processing which can take some time depending on the number of scans submitted. Optionally, you can save the MZminePI project and come back later. When you load the saved project, it will bring you back to this same point.<br><br><img src="step05_JobLaunched.jpg"><br><br></li>
  <li>Now right click on the job to download the results from the Veritomyx servers. If the job is not complete yet, this will wait for the job to finish and then download and install the resulting peaks files.<br><br><img src="step06_Retrieve.jpg"><br><br></li>
  <li>Once the job results are downloaded, the peaks lists are loaded under each of the scans originally selected.<br>

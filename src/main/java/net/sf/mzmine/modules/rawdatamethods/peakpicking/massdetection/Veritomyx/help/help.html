<h1>Veritomyx PeakInvestigator™ Peak Detection Software for Metabolomics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<blockquote>
<table><tr><td valign=top>
  <p align="justify">Mass spectral raw and processed results often fail to deconvolve and  consider crucial data. This contributes to inaccurate, incomplete and  inefficient protein and metabolite identifications. Veritomyx, Inc. mass  spectral analysis software applies advanced signal processing and  identification algorithms to reveal hidden data and accelerate to  correct biomolecular identifications. This improves R&amp;D  effectiveness while saving time and money.</p>

    <p align="justify">Critical data remain hidden when
      overlapping peaks are unresolved. Unresolved peaks cause:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Inaccurate IDs</li>
      <li>Misdirected efforts</li>
      <li>Wasted time and resources</li>
      <li>Missed biomarkers</li>
    </ul>
 </td><td valign="top"><img src="whatMissing.jpg"></td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan="2"><p align="justify"><a href="http://www.veritomyx.com/PeakInvestigator.php">PeakInvestigator™</a> mass spectral analysis software detects and precisely deconvolves  hidden overlapped peaks, accelerating you to confident molecular  identifications in your metabolomics workflow. PeakInvestigator doubles  the effective resolution of virtually any existing mass analyzer. Unleashing important discoveries that would have remained hidden in your data offers critical leverage for scientific and business success.</p>
